The old lighthouse keeper, Silas, squinted at the storm brewing. He’d seen countless, but this one felt different, angry. He checked the lamp, its beam a defiant finger against the encroaching darkness. Hours passed, the wind howling like a banshee. Suddenly, a small sailboat appeared, tossed like a toy in the monstrous waves. Silas knew they wouldn't survive. He grabbed his oilskins, and descended the winding stairs, ignoring his aching knees. Launching the small rescue boat was a battle against the elements, but he rowed with a desperate strength born of duty. He reached the sailboat, pulling two terrified figures aboard. Back at the lighthouse, warm and safe, the rescued family looked at Silas, their eyes filled with gratitude. He simply smiled, pointing towards the lamp. "It's always been my job to keep it burning."
