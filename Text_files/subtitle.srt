1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,624
The old lighthouse keeper. Silas squinted at the storm

2
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:07,384
brewing. Back at the lighthouse, warm and safe, the rescued

3
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:10,792
family looked at Silas, their eyes filled with gratitude.

4
00:00:10,856 --> 00:00:14,808
He simply smiled, pointing towards the lamp. It's always been my job

5
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:18,744
to keep it burning. He'd seen countless, but this one felt different.

6
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:22,568
Angry. He checked the lamp, its beam a defiant finger against

7
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:26,024
the encroaching darkness. Hours passed, the wind howling like

8
00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:29,486
a banshee. Suddenly, a small sailboat appeared,

9
00:00:29,598 --> 00:00:33,150
tossed like a toy in the monstrous waves. Silas knew they

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,606
wouldn't survive. He grabbed his oilskins and descended

11
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:41,086
the winding stairs, ignoring his aching knees. Launching the small rescue

12
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:44,510
boat was a battle against the elements, but he rowed with

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,382
a desperate strength born of duty. He reached the sailboat,

14
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:50,350
pulling two terrified figures aboard.
