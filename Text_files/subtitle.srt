1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,864
The chessboard shimmered not wood, but polished apple skin,

2
00:00:03,992 --> 00:00:07,464
red and green squares glinting. Checkmate. The apple kingdom

3
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:10,968
crumbled, succumbing to the tart queen's strategic brilliance.

4
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:14,872
The board rizet ready for another sweet and sour battle.

5
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:17,976
King Apple, a plump fugee with a toothpick crown,

6
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:22,296
surveyed his candied fruit army. Across the board, Queen Granny Smith,

7
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:25,748
tart and strategic, adjusted her leafy headdress.

8
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:29,292
Pawn pair soldiers advanced, their sweet scent filling the

9
00:00:29,316 --> 00:00:33,372
air. King Apple sacrificed a brave gala knight, a noble

10
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:36,924
crunch echoing. Granny Smith countered with a caramel

11
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:40,940
rook, trapping a citrus bishop. The tension was palpable.

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,076
A cherry balm bishop exploded near King Apple,

13
00:00:44,188 --> 00:00:47,884
leaving a sticky mess. In a final gambit, Queen Granny Smith

14
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:48,140
moved.
